# artwork

Styling and graphical assets... A first stab at a logo is available, files are [here](images), for example:

## Design brief

This design is intended to communicate a stylized raindeer, which simultaneously looks a little bit like a Nordic mountain ("fj√§ll") and/or a river with some mountain birches. There is also the midnight sun in the background, suggesting a reference to Scandinavia and perhaps suggesting a reference to the traditional owners of the land - the Sami people - and the biodiversity in that area of the country.

The logo uses signature colors close to those used in palettes from the [Atlas of Living Australia](https://www.ala.org.au/) and [GBIF](https://gbif.org).

## Improvments

Improvements or suggestions are welcome! 

It is possible to outsource artwork/design work through intermediaries like [99designs](https://99designs.com/how-it-works) for a reasonable price (a few hundred dollars or so).
